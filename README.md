# 12_Assign_COL100
Hello guys, this is my code for assignment 12 of my course COL100 at IIT Delhi.
As you will see, the organization.c file is my approach to the problem. I have used 2 linked list. Hope you enjoy reading it.
Raise any errors or problems if you find in the code.
Suggestions are also welcome :)

Now the binary_12.py and execute_12.sh files work together. They generator 1000 random testcases as input and ouptput textfiles.
I took the inspiration for random binary tree generation code from the following website - https://www.codespeedy.com/random-binary-tree-generator-using-python/

Now, in order to test your solution to the problem (obivously, u can't compare 1000 files) I have created the checker.py

Compile your code and save it as a.exe
put in correct file names as - 
put in your file name in the code, file to be checked against(u can use my output) and the input file in checker.py. 

This will generate 1000 checks and will also tell you the time it took to execute those 1000 files and check them.
This is it for now. 
Code out!!
